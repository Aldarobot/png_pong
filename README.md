This is a pure Rust PNG image decoder and encoder taking inspiration from
lodepng.  This crate allows easy reading and writing of PNG files without any
system dependencies.

### Why another PNG crate?

These are the 4 Rust PNG encoder/decoder crates I know of:
- [png] - The one everyone uses (used to be able to load less pngs than
  png\_pong and slower, but has caught up).
- [lodepng] - Loads all the PNGs, code is ported from C, therefore code is hard
  read & maintain, also uses slow implementation of deflate/inflate algorithm.
- [imagefmt] - Abandoned, and limited in what files it can open, but with a lot
  less lines of code.
- [imagine] - PNG decoding only.

Originally I made the [aci\_png] based on imagefmt, and intended to add more
features.  At the time, I didn't want to write a PNG encoder/decoder from
scratch so I decided to take `lodepng` which has more features (and more low
level features) and clean up the code, upgrade to 2018 edition of Rust, depend
on the miniz\_oxide crate (because it can decompress faster than lodepng's
INFLATE implementation) and get rid of the libc dependency so it *actually*
becomes pure Rust (lodepng claimed to be, but called C's malloc and free).
Then, I rewrote the entire library, based on [gift] and [pix].

### Goals

 - Forbid unsafe.
 - APNG support as iterator.
 - Fast.
 - Compatible with pix / gift-style API.
 - Load all PNG files crushed with pngcrush.
 - Save crushed PNG files.
 - Clean, well-documented, concise code.
 - Implement all completed, non-deprecated chunks in the
   [PNG 1.2 Specification], including the [PNG 1.2 Extensions] and the
   [APNG Specification]

### TODO

 - Implement APNG reading.
 - Implement Chunk reading (with all the different chunk structs).
 - StepDecoder should wrap StepDecoder, RasterEncoder should wrap ChunkEncoder
 - More test cases to test against.

### Benchmarks And Comparisons

TODO: Update, ran on older png\_pong and Rust 1.52.1

Using Rust 1.52.1, criterion and 4 different PNG sizes with PNGs from
"./tests/png/" (units are: us / microseconds).  I stopped anything that was
predicted to take longer than a half hour with criterion with the message
"TIMEOUT".

- sRGBA 1x1: Uses `tests/png/test.png`
- sRGB 64x64: Uses `test/png/4.png`
- sRGBA 64x64: Uses `tests/png/res.png`
- sRGB 256x256: `tests/png/PngSuite.png`
- sRGBA 256x256: Uses `tests/png/icon.png`
- sRGB 4096x4096: `tests/png/plopgrizzly.png`
- sRGBA 4096x4096: Uses `tests/png/noise.png`
